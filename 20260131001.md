Howdy, Surfers of the World Wide Web!

I've decided to dive into the world of **Go** and **web development**.
To make the learning process practical and fun, I'm building a basic **Quality Management System (QMS)** as a hands-on project.

The GitHub repository is live. My immediate focus is to get the core foundation ready.
Here is the roadmap for **version 0.1.0**:

1. **Infrastructure:** Set up the Go project with a clean folder structure.
2. **Database:** Initialize SQLite and create the documents table to prepare for data storage.
3. **API:** Build a functional router with an `/api/health` endpoint to verify the server is running.
4. **DevOps:** Create a Dockerfile compatible with Podman to containerize the application.

That is the plan for now!
